# GetTix-1
GetTix is an Android app designed and implemented by Idan Sasson as main assignment for Advanced Java Workshop in the Open University. 
The app provides users with the ability to search for cultural events of all categories (music, theater, dance, lectures, stand-ups, kids, sports) and order tickets to those events. The search can be done by date, location, category and keyword. In the ordering process, the user may choose his/her seats from a seat map.
The app also includes management options for authenticated event producers, that may create or edit new events or venues, as well as watch informative reports for events (income etc).
